### linear regression scikit-learn packag
- sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegressn() class is supervised
reression tdhnique an it can be used ot fit lines to inpu data

- `r2 score (coefficeint of Dteremination` is measure of how well
the model has fit the input data. Its general range is [0,1] but 
it can get negative values also. 
- `r2_score = 1 - SS_res / SS_total` where 
    - SS_total is the sum of squared differences b/w mean of target 
    variable and target variable itself
    - SS_res is the sum of squared fiference b/w predicted and 
    target variables
